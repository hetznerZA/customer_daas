To run the test suite against the Test Frame Architecture prototype (this directory):

Prepare the environment:

o check out a local copy of the SOAR architecture
o set the SOAR_DIR environment variable to point to your local copy:
o Modify the SOAR run.sh and comment out the CFGSRV_IDENTIFIER entry. Now SOAR will use config/config.yml
o Use features/support/config*.example to create /features/support/config*.yml appropriately to point to your google spreadsheet containing the policies you want to test with
 
Inject the TFA into SOAR:
o cp tfa/jewels/*.zip $SOAR_DIR/jewels
o cd $SOAR_DIR
o jewels/extract_jewel.sh status (delete the /status route from lib/web/router.rb if this fails)
o jewels/inject_jewel.sh status
o jewels/inject_jewel.sh available_policies
o jewels/inject_jewel.sh validate_credential_using_policy
o jewels/inject_jewel.sh generate-credential
o jewels/inject_jewel.sh index
./run.sh

Run the tests:
SOAR_DIR=/Users/ernstv/Documents/hetzner/recipe_rack_web_service TEST_ORCHESTRATION_PROVIDER=tfa rake test
